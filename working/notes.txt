I had to move the "material," class into `hitable.nim` because Nim doesn't
currently support forward declarations for types.

I'm not using pointers to materials, it's easier this way

The hitable_list doesn't have a size on it's constructor

For the `color()` function in `main.nim`, I added a maxDepth variable at the top
of the file, so you can (easily) change the render depth.

Instead of hardcoding in the render depth as 50 in the `color()` function, I
gave it its own variable as `maxDepth`.

Instead of only rendering to standard output, you can render to a file.  By
default the filename is "render.ppm".

`_time` is known as `time` in the `ray` object.  Nim doesn't like fields that
end (or start) with an underscore.  The same goes for `aabb`'s `min` and `max`
fields.

In `bvh_node`'s constructor, it takes a sequence of hitables (instead of a
dynamic list of hitables).  The `n` paramter was also removed since sequence
makes it unecessary

Instead of using `qsort()`, we use Nim's `algorithm.sort()` method on sequences
instead.

`random_scene()` and `two_sphers()` are found in the file `scenes.nim`.

The static members of the `perlin` class are still found in `perlin.nim`, but
they are not part of the `perlin` type.  Originally they were dynamic arrays
(with a set size of 256), but not they are sequqnces.
